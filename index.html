          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Current hydration tracking apps aren’t engaging enough and fail to inspire users to be motivated to enter their hydration consumption. By gamifying the app, we can enhance user engagement and motivation, ultimately leading to an improvement in their water consumption goals.
          </p>
          <h3>Roles</h3>
          <p>
            This was an group project of 3 where responsibilities were shared with UX Researcher, UX Designer, UX Writer and UI Designer.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            We have conducted in depth 1-1 user interviews to find out more about water consumption and hydration tracking. Further we have carried out quantitative research conducting a survey to gauge water consumption and hydration tracking habits from a larger sample. We wanted to find out what factors influence individuals' water consumption and hydration habits? How we could personalise an app to meet individual needs and preferences? And what gamification features should be included in the app to improve motivation and engagement? Our research targeted fitness enthusiasts and individuals under 30 seeking habit changes.

          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>
            During interviews and surveys, we discovered that a majority of people aged 25-30 are motivated when receiving rewards to complete a task. Our app aims to address the issue of inadequate water intake among individuals who are dissatisfied with their current consumption levels. We believe that by gamifying the app, we can enhance user engagement and motivation, ultimately leading to an improvement in their water consumption goals.

          <p>
            In this storyboard Lucas suspects not drinking enough water has been causing his tiredness and headaches. He turns to our app, which allows him to personalise goals. As he is tracking his water intake, he is motivated by app’s health tips and fun badges. With Blu's help, Lucas manages to not only increase his water intake, but also earning points that can be exchanged for incentives, resulting in a sense of accomplishment and making him feel great.

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            Using Figma, we created mockups that facilitated user registration, onboarding, goal setting, water consumption tracking, and reward systems. Guerrilla tests were conducted to gather user feedback, which was recorded and analyzed. Based on the frequency of responses, we prioritized feature enhancements. Significant improvements were made to the coaching, onboarding, goal, and reward screens, as well as the overall visual experience.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            During our user testing, we discovered that people really enjoyed our reward system, but we found that they needed more information on what they could redeem. So moving forward, we plan to continue iterating and testing new features, including expanding upon the reward system. Overall, the users loved the gamification aspect and the simplicity of the design, showing interest in further development.
